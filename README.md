# STM8_rfmodulator_lib
Just a simple library to control MBS74T1AEF rf modulator chip found in old satellite TV tuners, uses bit-banging for I2C communication. RF TV modulator can be used for bringing your tv back to life, also, I will add link to russian forum, that talks about modification for amplifying this signal and creating small TV station good for one room and avoiding FCC detection, (or ČTÚ in Czechia).
# Usage
This library was made for cosmic compiler, so you can just directly paste source and header files into your project folder src and inc.
